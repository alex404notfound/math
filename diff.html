                1. Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)
                <br>
                Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) involve functions of a single variable and their derivatives. They are called "ordinary" to distinguish them from partial differential equations, which involve multiple variables. ODEs are classified based on their order, which is the highest derivative of the function that appears in the equation.
                <br>
                First-Order ODEs: These involve only the first derivative of the function. An example is $$\frac{dy}{dx}=f(x,y)$$ $$\frac{dy}{dx}=f(x,y)$$, which describes curves in the xy-plane where the slope at any point is given by f(x,y)f(x,y).
                Second-Order and Higher ODEs: These involve second or higher derivatives. They frequently appear in physics; for example, Newton's second law of motion leads to second-order differential equations.

                <br>
                2. Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
                <br>
                Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) involve functions of multiple variables and their partial derivatives. They are essential in the mathematical modelling of systems in which changes occur in more than one direction, such as the propagation of heat or waves.
                <br>
                Linear PDEs: Where the dependent variable and its derivatives appear linearly. The classic examples are the heat equation, wave equation, and Laplace's equation.
                Nonlinear PDEs: These are more complex, as the dependent variable or its derivatives appear nonlinearly. The Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow are a famous example.
                <br>
                3. Linear Differential Equations
                <br>
                Linear Differential Equations can be ordinary or partial and are characterized by the linear appearance of the dependent variable and its derivatives. They do not contain products or other nonlinear functions of the variable and its derivatives. Linear equations are easier to solve than nonlinear equations and have well-developed solution techniques.
                <br>
                4. Nonlinear Differential Equations
                <br>
                Nonlinear Differential Equations are those in which the dependent variable or its derivatives appear in a nonlinear form. These equations are generally more difficult to solve analytically, and solutions often require numerical methods. Nonlinear equations can exhibit complex behavior such as chaos.
                5. Homogeneous and Non-Homogeneous Differential Equations
                <br>
                Homogeneous Differential Equations: These have terms that depend only on the function and its derivatives. In the context of linear differential equations, a homogeneous equation is one in which every term is a function of the dependent variable and its derivatives, with no constant or standalone variable terms.
                Non-Homogeneous Differential Equations: These include additional terms that do not depend solely on the function and its derivatives. These terms can represent external forces or inputs in physical systems.
                <br>
                Applications and Solving Methods
                <br>
                Each type of differential equation has its solving methods, ranging from analytical solutions for simpler equations to numerical methods for more complex cases. Applications are vast, including:
                <br>
                ODEs: Modeling population dynamics, radioactive decay, or mechanical systems.
                PDEs: Describing phenomena like fluid flow, heat distribution, or electromagnetic fields.
                <br>
                Understanding the type of differential equation at hand is crucial for choosing the appropriate solution method and interpreting the results within the context of the problem being solved.

            <h2>Malthusian Model of Population:
            </h2>
<p>Proposed by Thomas Malthus, this model suggests that population grows exponentially while resources grow arithmetically. Eventually, population growth will outpace resources, leading to famine, disease, and war, which reduce the population back to sustainable levels.
</p>
            <h2>Logistic Population Growth Model:</h2> Also known as the Verhulst model, it is an extension of the Malthusian model. It introduces a carrying capacity, representing the maximum population size an environment can sustain. Population growth slows as it approaches this limit, resulting in an S-shaped curve.

            <h2>SIR Model (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered):</h2> This epidemiological model divides the population into three compartments: susceptible, infectious, and recovered. It helps analyze the spread of infectious diseases by tracking how individuals move between these compartments over time.

    <h2>SEIR Model (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered):</h2> An extension of the SIR model, the SEIR model introduces an "exposed" compartment to account for individuals who have been infected but are not yet infectious. This allows for a more accurate representation of the disease's incubation period.
    <h2>Lanchester's Combat Models:</h2> Developed by Frederick Lanchester, these models are used to analyze combat between two military forces. They describe how the strength of each force changes over time based on factors like attrition rates, force size, and the effectiveness of weapons.

    Romeo and Juliet's Wall Model of Love: This model, inspired by Shakespeare's tragic play, "Romeo and Juliet," illustrates how societal barriers (represented by the metaphorical wall) can intensify romantic feelings between individuals from opposing groups. The separation amplifies the desire to be together, leading to drastic actions.

    Population Competition and Predation Models: These ecological models explore the dynamics between species in an ecosystem. Competition models describe how species compete for resources, while predation models examine the interactions between predator and prey populations, often represented using mathematical equations like the Lotka-Volterra models.
